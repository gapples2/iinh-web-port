Upgrades
Successor adds +1 to gain
Doubler makes gain 2x
Quadrupler makes gain 4x
Hexadecatupler makes gain 16x
Squarer makes gain ^2
Gems
Gems are gained from points. This could be a prestige layer in your game, idk
You can use gems to buy gem upgrades, such as tripling gain and stuff
Refactor
Refactor is a semi-forced reset that gives a multiplier and refactor points. Refactor points are used to unlock challenges and buy upgrades in the Research era.
Challenges
Challenges are able to be completed up to 5 times, and take place within a refactor. Challenges are harder refactors.
Challenge 1 - Normal run (You are in this challenge by default)
Challenge 2 - Slowmode (In your game, you can make it so production is divided by 10 or something)
Challenge 3 - No refactor mult
Challenge 4 - No gem upgrades
Challenge 5 - All previous challenges
Challenge 6 - Cube root
Challenge 7 - Depends on options selected (Make your own challenge) (Takes place within an Omega run)
Research
You can buy Research Points with points. Research Points can be used to buy Research Upgrades.
For example, one research unlocks 2 new refactor upgrades and gives you +5 refactor points.
Another research unlocks Challenge 6.
Most researches boost production
Omega
Once you reach 1.79e308 points, you can Omega, which resets your number, and gives you Omega Cubes and Omega Tesseracts.
Omega Cubes can be spent on non-repeatable upgrades, and Omega Tesseracts can be spent on Compacts, which multiply production by 1e100x each.
In your game, Omega should probably reset everything previous, and there could be milestones or QoL upgrades.
Challenge 7
Challenge 7 works like Hadronic Challenge in DI. You can turn different options on, and you get challenge score based on the amount of options turned on and how far you get.
You must have at least 1.79e308 points to exit C7 with challenge score.
Challenge 7 doesn't have a completion system.
